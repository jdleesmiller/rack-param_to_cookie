== SYNOPSIS

Rack::ParamToCookie is a rack middleware that extracts request parameters from requests and stores them in cookies for use in future requests. It's useful for affiliate, referral or promotion links, which often work something like:

1. A referral partner puts a link on their site to somewhere on your site, and they include a request parameter like +ref+ so you can identify traffic from them, e.g. https://www.example.com/some-interesting-page?ref=123ABC
1. A user clicks through the link and comes to your site.
1. The Rack::ParamToCookie middleware finds the +ref+ parameter and stores it in a cookie for this user.
1. The user browses around for a while and eventually signs up.
1. Your sign up action recovers the referral code, +123ABC+, from the cookie, and you mark it as a successful referral from your partner.
1. $$$$!

== Usage

In a Rails app, you can add it as middleware in +config/application.rb+. For a parameter called +ref+, the basic usage is:

  config.middleware.use 'Rack::ParamToCookie', 'ref' => {}

This tells Rack::ParamToCookie to capture a request parameter called +ref+, store it in a cookie called +ref+, and make it available in your rails app as <tt>request.env['ref']</tt>. You can specify multiple parameters and configure them. Here's a more in-depth example:

  config.middleware.use 'Rack::ParamToCookie',
    'ref' => {cookie_name: 'referral_code',
              env_name: 'referral.code',
              ttl: 14*24*60*60,
              max_length: 12},
    'aff' => {cookie_name: 'affiliate_code',
              env_name: 'affiliate.code'}

The first cookie, +referral_code+ for parameter +ref+, has a 14 day time to live, can be a maximum of 12 characters and is accessible in +request.env+ <tt>['referral.code']</tt>. The second, for parameter +aff+, has the default time to live, which is 30 days and can be the default maximum length, which is 64 characters.

== Installation

Add to your Gemfile

  gem 'rack-param_to_cookie'

Or install directly

  gem install rack-param_to_cookie

You can load it with

  require 'rack/param_to_cookie'

== Credits

This middleware is mostly based on Rack::Affiliates (https://github.com/alexlevin/rack-affiliates); this middleware is just a bit more generic and configurable.
